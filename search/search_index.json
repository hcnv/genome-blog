The post is a reminder of the history of some data structures now implemented throughout GA4GH aligned projects. While developing the (metadata-)schema for the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health , the Metadata Task Team decided (after, well, many hours of telecons) to use an object based model with a limited number of attributes. In place of specific, named attributes, emphasis is being put on the use of ontologies, which, in principle, provide their own scoping. Diagnoses, phenotypes, species assignment and other \u201cbiocharacteristics\u201d were to be represented in as \u201cOntologyTerm\u201d objects, using schema-external ontology services such as EBI\u2019s OLS. As part of a \u201chuman data implementation study\u201d supported through ELIXIR, our group at the University of Zurich uses the data from our arraymap.org cancer genome resource, to test and implement genome and metadata representations compatible to a forward looking version of the GA4GH schemas. In arrayMap, all of the currently >55,000 cancer genome datasets have been coded to the diagnostic codes (morphology and topography) from the International Classification of Diseases in Oncology (ICD-O 3). The internal representation using CURIE coding with an internal/unregistered \u201cPGX\u201d prefix of these ICD codes as GA4GH \u201cBiocharacteristic\u201d object is shown here 1 : Updated Version - e.g. Progenetix 2022 Original Version 2017 { \"icdo_morphology\" : { \"id\" : \"pgx:icdom-94703\" , \"label\" : \"Medulloblastoma, NOS\" }, \"icdo_topography\" : { \"id\" : \"pgx:icdot-C71.6\" , \"label\" : \"cerebellum\" } } \"bio_characteristics\" : [ { \"description\" : \"medulloblastoma\" , \"ontology_terms\" : [ { \"term_label\" : \"Medulloblastoma, NOS\" , \"term_id\" : \"PGX:ICDOM:9470_3\" }, { \"term_label\" : \"cerebellum\" , \"term_id\" : \"PGX:ICDOT:C716\" }, ], \"negated_ontology_terms\" : [ ], }, ] However, we had to realize that the ICD-O classification, while having a shallow hierarchical component, right now is not an registered, open ontology and cannot be referenced through ontology services. Therefore, our own \u2013 rather well organized data \u2013 could not serve to exemplify ontology use in the GA4GH schema. And while ICD-O codes are represented in SNOMED-CT, their use is restricted through licensing; additionally the hierarchical component of the ICD derived codes are out of date and/or misleading. NCIt to the rescue Through their NCI Metathesaurus (NCIm), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provides a wide-ranging biomedical terminology database. While the included terms describe concepts from various scopes, the \u201cNCIt Neoplasm Core\u201d (NPLcore) represents the most frequent neoplastic entities in a simplified hierarchy system, by site and morphology. We decided to add NCIt terms to all neoplastic samples in our arrayMap database, by using our previous in-house generated ICD coding to assign NCIt neoplasm core codes to unique combinations of ICD-O morphology and topography. For our sample mapping (below), we used either the code from NPLcore, or a basic \u201ctissue type\u201d assignment, if the best code wasn\u2019t represented in NPLcore (this seems somewhat circuitous, but will be required to represent the samples in the hierarchy). Our arrayMap 2 re-mapping currently leads us to 44915 mapped cancer genome arrays from GEO experiments (i.e., all have a NCBI GEO \u201cGSM\u201d identifier; other samples were re-mapped, too). The current representation in arrayMap does noy yet may use of the hierarchical representation; this is planned for the near future. This is preliminary; we\u2019ll be happy about corrections, suggestions etc. Also, the mapping should be considered a \u201cliving document\u201d; we will probably expand & refine over time (& maybe switch to \u201cNCIt first, ICD derived\u201d approach. The current mapping of arrayMap samples to the GA4GH schema is shown in our arraymap2ga4gh github repository \u2013 which will be topic of another post.

Such studies can deliver interesting information about phenotypic heritability, or even may lead to the identification of genes or genome elements causally related to specific traits or disease risks. However, a common problem in the reporting of genotype-phenotype associations from GWAS studies through news outlets or even the PR departments of universities or organisations involved in such studies lies in the conflation of association and causality. So, some guidelines: GWAS report, well, associations of genomic variants (usually SNV, occasionally CNV) with phenotypes/traits/disease risk etc. These markers (even if holding up in confirmation studies) most likely have no causality with respect to the phenotypic quality. They are markers because of a statistical probability to co-segregate with the observed phenotype/trait, due to a low genomic distance (i.e. low probability of recombination) from a possibly causative genomic variant. Since such markers are just this, they cannot kill you, make you live longer, lead to a happy life \u2026 Some more details about GWAS can e.g. be found in this older but still valid blog post by Jeff Barrett . So: Even if a genome marker (i.e. specific SNP) has a high concordance with a given trait (such as longevity \u2013 and there are way too many to be concerned about a single one) \u2013 markers are just that. And when reporting about them, a language of \u201cgenome variant showing statistical association with\u201d instead of \u201cresponsible for\u201d has to be used. Now about effect size \u2026 But I wanted to stay brief.","title":"Markers, Markers Everywhere - Will they Kill Me?

While \"High-Throughput\" sequencing technologies are increasingly becoming the primary choice for genomic screening analysis, their ability to efficiently detect CNVs is still heterogeneous and remains to be developed. The aim of this white paper is to provide a guiding framework for the future contributions of ELIXIR's recently established h uman CNV Community, with implications beyond human disease diagnostics and population genomics. This white paper is the direct result of a strategy meeting that took place in September 2018 in Hinxton (UK) and involved representatives of 11 ELIXIR Nodes. The meeting led to the definition of priority objectives and tasks, to address a wide range of CNV-related challenges ranging from detection and interpretation to sharing and training. Here, we provide suggestions on how to align these tasks within the ELIXIR Platforms strategy, and on how to frame the activities of this new ELIXIR Community in the international context.

A visualization of some Beacon v2 concepts (from docs.genomebeacons.org ) Beacon v2 represents a major revision of the original concept, with a completely new code base and a focus on high flexibility through its modular design. The Beacon code base includes both the framework - i.e. the specific ation for the general formats & components of requests and responses to a Beacon v2 server - as well as the default model which provides schemas for the representation of data from different domains (e.g. genomic variations, biosamples) as well as query parameters. With respect to the exchange of information about structural genome variation data, Beacon v2 explicitely allows for CNV queries either through simple genomic \"Range Queries\" as well as \"Bracket Queries\", for which individual genomic brackets for start and end positions can be specified. Please refer to the documentation for further details. Also included in the documentation is a comparison of the \"variant type\" use across different specifications, e.g. how CNVs (and their subtypes) are represented in EFO, VCF, VRS ... and in Beacon queries.

Based on a set of well defined samples, this data can be considered a \"high-quality resource for germline CNV data\", for disease and population analysis projects. Now, this data is being made available though the Progenetix resource's API . 1000 Genomes Germline CNVs on Progenetix LINK: progenetix.org/progenetix-cohorts/oneKgenomes/ \u00b6 Background As an international, collaborative effort, since 2008 the 1kGP has worked on the identification and characterization of \"normal\" genetic variation across diverse populations. The current dataset represents the original 2504 individuals from 26 populations as well as recently added genomes for 698 individuals with genetic relations, containing 535 parent-child triads as well as other non-triad pedigrees. The 1kGP remains one of the most widely used references for naturally occurring genetic variation in human populations. With over 5400 citations in the scientific literature to date, the 1kGP is regarded as \u201can essential tool\u201d for genomic studies ranging from the evolutionary history of humankind to elucidating molecular mechanisms such as linkage disequilibrium and genetic recombination to the discovery and validation of disease-associated genetic mutations. While a large part of the 1kGP utilization has been based on its representation of single nucleotide variants (SNPs) as well as their linkage, the WGS data has also been used to map CNVs and to utilize this information for the identification of CNV-related diseases. For example, 1kGP data played an important role in the development of a sequence-based tool that identifies copy number variation in the SMN1 and SMN2 genes, which are used as genetic markers for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) risk. Researchers used 1kGP data to assess SMN1 and SMN2 copy number variation variants (CNV), and the identification of variant sites that can be used to reliably differentiate the two close paralogs SMN1 and SMN2 across all populations. Data Formats While the CNV data of the 1000 genomes project is of high utility for research into genetic diseases and cancer, so far the genomic data has been stored in VCF files, which may be inconvenient for many use cases (e.g. fast lookup of CNVs for a specific location) and also be affected by ambiguities in VCF parsing for CNVs and other structural variants. As part of our for the Progenetix repository and related to the Beacon project of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and ELIXIR, the Computational Cytogenetics and Cancer Genomics group at the University of Zurich and SIB has implemented a version of the 1kGP CNV dataset, accessible through the Progenetix BeaconPlus API. At this time (May 2022) both the (still internal) VCF conversion tools as well as the data should be considered \"under construction\" and awaiting community feedback. Particularly, the final format may undergo changes based on the emerging representation of relative and absolute CNV values in the GA4GH VRS standard. API The Progenetix resource provides an overview of mutation data in cancer, predominantly as the largest public resource of curated copy number abnormalities (CNV / CNA), for all types of human malignancies. Integrated into the Progenetix framework, we built an online oneKgenomes cohort with a dedicated landing page and a Beacon v2 compatible API and to enable federated access to this reference data using a recently accepted accepted GA4GH data standard. Besides the API access, users will be presented with a web interface, to search the variants, download the data, do online analyses and retrieve the visualization of the results. The data is based on currently 3202 samples from the Illumina DRAGEN re-analysis of the 1000 genomes project's deep WGS data on the AWS platform.

The supposed effects depend on the magnitude of change, i.e. the number of gained or lost copies. Especially in cancer cells the \"normal\" allele count for the given genomic region has to be considered: Cancer genomes may have undergone general anaeuplodization events with preceding and/or followed by regional CNV events. Copy number changes can be expressed as absolute (total allele count) and relative (e.g. uncalibrated CN measurements such as log2 ratio) values. Empirically - and to overcome a number of issues of exact CN count calibrations - a classification into a number CN types has become \"standard operating procedure\" with details differing to some extent. This post attempts to summarize some previous annotation practices and emerging standards for CNV annotation, especially with respect to somatic CNVs and cancer genomics. Additional measures which have been used in some of those classification attempts have been: the locality of additional copies of genomic regions in gain CNVs the size of the CNV events an overall context or inferred mechanism Here we will mostly consider 2 - the CNV size - where it makes sense; the locality or overall mechanism (such as \"chromothripsis\", \"katagesis\" etc.) constitute special cases which in some cases (e.g. many tandem duplications) can be considered gene specific structural alterations more than \"dosage events\". Regarding the CNV size, CNVs can broadly be separated into \"cytogenetic\" or \"arm-level\" changes 1 which arise from errors in chromosomal distribution during cellular division with or without structural chromosomal rearrangements, and \"focal\" CNVs based on DNA replication errors with smaller ( i.e. [sub-]megabase) deletions or (intra or extrachromosomal) multi-copy duplications 2 . While the role of disease-related, arm- and chromosome-level CNVs in cancer still is poorly understood, focal CNVs frequently involve the genomic locations of genes with known involvement in neoplastic processes. Importantly, the magnitude of these CNV size classes may differ. All arm-level gain CNVs and many focal CNVs have a low divergence in CN count while some focal CNVs can reach very high relative magnitude, such as an amplification with tens or hundreds of copies. However, the definition of genomic amplification is ambiguous. Generally, it means multiple copies of chromosomal segments, but the exact copy number threshold to define amplification is not consistent in multiple studies, varying from 4 to 9 or more (Table 1). For deletions, the definition of high-magnitude deletion is clear. It usually represents a complete loss of genomic elements and relevant functions. Purported Effects of CNV \"Classes\" in Oncogenomics \u00b6 The observation that high-amplitude focal CNVs often occur in specific regions where tumor oncogenes and suppressor genes locate indicates that this type of CNV is possible to contain the optimal chromosomal segments for promotion of cancer development and thus has great power to discover cancer-related genes. The prevalence of low-amplitude chromosomal arm-level CNVs in cancer patients shows a close relationship between CNV and molecular properties of cancer cells. The length and amplitude of somatic CNVs determine distinct classes of somatic CNVs. They are different in occurrence frequency and impact on genomic components. A better understanding of both types of somatic CNVs is important and required. Currently, there are several standards and ontologies to specify different classes of CNV.

More details can be found in the comparison table 2 (taken from the Beacon v2 documentation ).","title":"Purported Effects of CNV \"Classes\" in Oncogenomics"},{"location":"blog/2022-05-30-different-classes-SCNV/#varying-definitions-of-high-level-gain-cnvs","text":"Study ID & link Study name Threshold (>=) PMID:21494657 Network-Guided Analysis of Genes with Altered Somatic Copy Number and Gene Expression Reveals Pathways Commonly Perturbed in Metastatic Melanoma 4 PMID:17161620 Specificity, selection and significance of gene amplifications in cancer 5 PMID:32024823 High-coverage whole-genome analysis of 1220 cancers reveals hundreds of genes deregulated by rearrangement-mediated cis-regulatory alterations 5 PMID:35524475 Refinement of computational identification of somatic copy number alterations using DNA methylation microarrays illustrated in cancers of unknown primary 5 PMID:25719666 Whole genomes redefine the mutational landscape of pancreatic cancer 6 DOI:10.1036/ommbid.321 Gene Amplification in Human Cancers: Biological and Clinical Significance 7 PMID:25110350 Focal chromosomal copy number aberrations in cancer\u2014Needles in a genome haystack 9 COSMIC database 5 if ploidy <= 2.7 9 if ploidy > 2.7 PMID:28445112 Tracking the Evolution of Non\u2013Small-Cell Lung Cancer 2 x ploidy + 1 PMID:28104840 Tumor aneuploidy correlates with markers of immune evasion and with reduced response to immunotherapy logR >= 1","title":"Varying Definitions of \"High Level\" Gain CNVs"},{"location":"blog/2022-05-30-different-classes-SCNV/#a-cnv-classification-based-on-relative-cn-alterations","text":"In 2021 - based on a recognized need to formalize the representation of relative CN value classes as a concept capturing general usage scenarios from cancer genomics and genetics while accommodating different data generation practices - we proposed a set of basic CNV classes for adoption by the Experimental Factor Ontology, following discussions with members of the hCNV community and the GA4GH Variant Representation Standard working group.","title":"A CNV Classification Based on Relative CN Alterations"},{"location":"blog/2022-05-30-different-classes-SCNV/#term-use-comparison","text":"Beacon VCF SO EFO VRS Notes DUP DUP 3 SO:0001742 copy_number_gain EFO:0030070 copy number gain low-level gain (implicit) a sequence alteration whereby the copy number of a given genomic region is greater than the reference sequence DUP DUP 3 SO:0001742 copy_number_gain EFO:0030071 low-level copy number gain low-level gain DUP DUP 3 SO:0001742 copy_number_gain EFO:0030072 high-level copy number gain high-level gain commonly but not consistently used for >=5 copies on a bi-allelic genome region DUP DUP 3 SO:0001742 copy_number_gain EFO:0030073 focal genome amplification high-level gain commonly but not consistently used for >=5 copies on a bi-allelic genome region, of limited size (operationally max. 1-5Mb) DEL DEL 3 SO:0001743 copy_number_loss EFO:0030067 copy number loss partial loss (implicit) a sequence alteration whereby the copy number of a given genomic region is smaller than the reference sequence DEL DEL 3 SO:0001743 copy_number_loss EFO:0030068 low-level copy number loss partial loss DEL DEL 3 SO:0001743 copy_number_loss EFO:0030069 complete genomic deletion complete loss complete genomic deletion (e.g. homozygous deletion on a bi-allelic genome region) This represents an approximation and doesn't try to address the - fascinating - biology of genomic rearrangements such as chromothripsis, katagesis etc. Maybe another time... \u21a9 Beroukhim, Rameen, et al. \"The landscape of somatic copy-number alteration across human cancers.\" Nature 463.7283 (2010): 899-905. \u21a9 VCFv4.4 introduces an SVCLAIM field to disambiguate between in situ events (such as tandem duplications; known adjacency / break junction : SVCLAIM=J ) and events where e.g. only the change in abundance / read depth ( SVCLAIM=D ) has been determined.
