Most somatic CNVs are either very short (focal) or almost the length of a chromosome arm or whole 
chromosome (arm-level). The arm-level change was first visualized more than a hundred years ago. 
Abnormal chromosome structures and numbers can affect large genomic regions. With the development of 
array and sequencing technologies, the detection of smaller focal CNV is possible. It sometimes 
targets cancer-causing genes.

The background rates of both level somatic CNVs are different. The occurrence of focal CNVs is negatively 
associated with their length. Arm-level CNVs occur more frequently than expected by the inverse-length 
distribution related to focal CNVs, which applies to all cancer types. The amplitudes of 
these somatic CNVs are also not the same. All arm-level CNVs and many focal CNVs are of low amplitude 
while some focal CNVs can reach very high amplitude, such as amplification or homozygous deletion. 
The definition of high-amplitude deletion is clear. It usually represents a complete loss of 
genomic elements and relevant functions. However, the definition of amplification is ambiguous. 
Generally, it means multiple copies of chromosomal segments, but the exact copy number threshold 
to define amplification is not consistent in multiple studies, varying from 5 to 8 or can be higher 
when the ploidy of studied samples is larger than 2. 

The observation that high-amplitude focal CNVs often occur in specific regions where tumor 
oncogenes and suppressor genes locate indicates that this type of CNV is possible to contain 
the optimal chromosomal segments for promotion of cancer development and thus has great power 
to discover cancer-related genes. The prevalence of low-amplitude chromosomal arm-level CNVs
in cancer patients shows a close relationship between CNV and molecular properties of cancer cells. 
The length and amplitude of somatic CNVs determine distinct classes of somatic CNVs. They are 
different in occurrence frequency and impact on genomic components. A better understanding of 
both types of somatic CNVs is important and required.
